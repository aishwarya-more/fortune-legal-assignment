                                <p>A trademark is a symbol, a word, or words legally registered or established by use as representing a company or a product. It is a recognizable sign or an expression which identifies products or services of a particular source (individual business, legal entity or a company) from others.</p>
                                <p>One vital function of a trademark is to exclusively identify the commercial source or origin of products or services. Trademarks basically serve to distinguish one specific or distinct business as the source of goods or services. It must be noted here that <b>certain exclusive rights are attached to a registered trademark.</b></p>

                  <p><b>INFRINGEMENT ON TRADEMARK RIGHTS:</b></p>
                  <p>Trademark infringement is a violation of the exclusive rights that are attached to a registered trademark and use of the registered Trademark without the authorisation of the trademark owner or licensee. Infringement may occur when the person infringing uses a trademark which is identical or confusingly similar to a registered trademark owned by another person in relation to the goods or services provided by the trademark owner. There are two types of remedies available for infringement to the owner of trademark. One is an action for passing off in the case of an unregistered trademark. This is common law remedy. The Civil remedies available are suit for injunction i.e. stay against the use of Trademark and can also claim for the loss suffered by the trademark owner. The other remedy is an action for infringement in case of a registered trademark. This is a statutory remedy. In such cases, a criminal case can also be filed. Under the Trade Marks Act, 1999, the offences under the Act are cognizable, meaning that the police can lodge an FIR (First Information Report) and prosecute the offenders directly.</p>
